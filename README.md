# House-Prices---Advanced-Regression-Techniques

# House Prices Prediction
Predicting house prices has become a crucial aspect of understanding the housing market and shaping policies that impact the economy. With the aid of machine learning techniques, estimating the future selling prices of properties has become more accurate and reliable. This process involves analyzing historical data and various factors that influence the housing market, treating it as a regression problem.
Predicting house prices through machine learning techniques has become an indispensable tool for policymakers, economists, and prospective homebuyers alike. By analyzing historical data and market factors, these predictions aid in shaping informed decisions and strategies for navigating the ever-evolving housing market landscape.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains various features or attributes that could potentially influence the sale price of a property. These features include characteristics such as the building class, zoning classification, lot dimensions, neighborhood, construction details (year built, roof style, exterior materials, etc.), basement characteristics, living area dimensions, number of rooms and bathrooms, garage details, and additional features like porches, decks, pools, and fences.
The dataset is divided into two files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The `train.csv` file contains the training data, including the target variable `SalePrice`, which represents the actual sale price of each property. The `test.csv` file contains the data for which the sale prices need to be predicted.
The goal of this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the sale price of a property based on the provided features. This task can be approached using various machine learning techniques, such as feature engineering, regression models (e.g., linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting), and other advanced algorithms.
The dataset provides an opportunity to practice and hone skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, and model evaluation. Practitioners can experiment with different techniques to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and engineer new features that capture relevant information for predicting sale prices.
By leveraging this dataset, researchers and data scientists can gain valuable experience in working with real-world housing data, understanding the impact of various factors on property values, and developing accurate and robust predictive models. The insights gained from this analysis could be beneficial for real estate professionals, homeowners, and policymakers in understanding the housing market dynamics and making informed decisions.

# To approach the problem of predicting house prices

1. 1. **Data Preprocessing**: The initial phase involves collecting and preprocessing the data. This entails gathering a comprehensive dataset from the provided files and ensuring its cleanliness by addressing missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. The data is loaded using pandas, and any missing values are identified and handled either by dropping the respective rows or by imputing values. Irrelevant columns, if any, are removed from the dataset. In the code snippet provided, missing values are checked for both the training and testing datasets, and appropriate actions are taken to handle them. Finally, the cleaned datasets are saved for further analysis and modeling. This process ensures that the data is in a suitable form for subsequent steps, such as feature engineering and model building.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, the dataset is analyzed to uncover patterns and relationships among its features. This involves loading the dataset using pandas and examining the data types of each column to understand their nature. Additionally, a correlation matrix is calculated to identify the relationships between numeric features. The correlation matrix is visualized using a heatmap to provide a clear overview of the correlations. Furthermore, a pairplot is created for selected features to visualize their pairwise relationships. Lastly, boxplots are generated to visualize the distribution of the target variable, SalePrice, across different categorical features, such as OverallQual, YearBuilt, and SaleCondition. These visualizations aid in gaining insights into the dataset and understanding the relationships between its various attributes.
3. **Model Selection and Training**: In the Model Selection and Training phase, appropriate machine learning algorithms are chosen and trained on the training dataset. To handle both numerical and categorical data, preprocessing pipelines are defined using scikit-learn's `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer`. For numerical columns, missing values are imputed using the mean strategy, while for categorical columns, the most frequent strategy is used for imputation, followed by one-hot encoding. The models considered for training include Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Hyperparameters for these models are fine-tuned using grid search with cross-validation. After training, the best-performing models are evaluated on the testing dataset using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. The RMSE values for each model indicate their performance on the testing dataset, with Gradient Boosting achieving the lowest RMSE of approximately 26,780. This phase helps in selecting the most suitable model for the given problem based on its performance on unseen data.
4. **Model Evaluation and Selection**: In the Model Evaluation and Selection phase, the models are evaluated on the testing dataset using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. The RMSE values for each model are computed and displayed. Among the evaluated models, Gradient Boosting achieved the lowest RMSE of approximately 26,780, indicating better performance in predicting the target variable compared to Linear Regression and Random Forest. Thus, based on the evaluation metrics, Gradient Boosting is selected as the best-performing model for this problem.
5.  **Model Deployment**: In the Model Deployment phase, the selected model is deployed for real-world use. Assuming 'model' represents the trained model and 'test_df' is the test DataFrame, predictions are generated for the test set using the trained model. These predictions, along with the corresponding 'Id' values, are then organized into a submission DataFrame. This DataFrame is saved to a CSV file named 'submission.csv', ensuring compatibility with submission requirements. This process allows for the seamless integration of the model into real-world applications, facilitating predictions on new data as it becomes available.
